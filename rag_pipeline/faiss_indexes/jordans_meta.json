FOR STEPPIN OUT ON DRY DAYS ON SIDEWALKS AND INDOORS. YOU DONT WEAR THESE WHEN THE WEATHER SUCKS OR ON GRASS. THEY DIE THAT DAY OR YOU ROCK EM A DOZEN PLUS TIMES FRESH WHITE WITH CARE.\n\nI love the court visions because how wide and comfortable they are. I have several pairs of Jordans but these are my daily wearers so I dont shuff up all my super expensive shoes, wear very loose and have multiple pairs to stay color coordinated. Great shoes.\n\nCame new, true to size husband loved em.\n\nThey fit great really  comfortable\n\nGot for my son, he says they are very comfortable and stylish, I like the old skool look, fast delivery and quality you can expect....5 stars\n\nI had the old version of this before they were pushing the recycled materials angle, and I can’t tell if they are the exact same or not. They are hard to break in and not comfortable at first around the ankle etc, and while I could wear low socks with my old ones, I need higher socks to avoid heel ankle chafing and such with these. Hopefully they break in and feel like the old court vision mid model.\n\nESTOS SON LOS UNICOS TENIS QUE USA MI ESPOSO  LOS COMPRO SIEMPRE\n\nGreat quality\n\nHusband likes them! He was looking for something more comfortable then his steel toe boots while traveling and these were a hit!\n\nBrought these for my son he like them they fit perfect 🩵🔥\n\nClassic Nike fresh white high tops for under $80!$?, $0LD.
