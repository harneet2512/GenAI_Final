The handle is also very comfortable to hold, and I appreciate how the top's position is reversible depending on whether I want to hold it with my left or right hand. The size of the mug is perfect for how much I sip on coldbrew throughout the day, and feels stable enough to not knock over easily in most circumstances.The only problem I have had so far is that if tipped over too far, your beverage can still spill through the seal on top even though it looks like it's completely covered. You have to practically tip it over completely for this to happen, so it's not that big of a deal in the scheme of things. The only thing I really would have wished for is an optional silicone grip for the bottom of the mug, as it feels like I could accidentally dent it on a hard surface if I'm not careful.

The only thing I really would have wished for is an optional silicone grip for the bottom of the mug, as it feels like I could accidentally dent it on a hard surface if I'm not careful. Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied and would recommend it to friends.\n\nI reluctantly purchased a real Stanley brand cup after getting knockoffs from Etsy. Although the Etsy ones were cute because I got them personalized with decorations, this by far is higher quality in terms of keeping my beverages cold. Literally my ice water last for a couple days in terms of the ice not melting. So, while I do not need another large tumbler, I would highly recommend to others to get a Stanley brand tumbler rather than a knockoff tumbler. I also really like that when I do close the lid in such a way that I don't have the straw in and the mouth area is covered, it really doesn't leak if I place it in my bag. That has been awesome. Oh, something that I do to make cleaning easier is I do not use the reusable straw. I ordered a bunch of large straws so that I can just use it and then throw it away and not have to deal with cleaning a straw.\n\nGot this in hopes of making  myself drink more water, which has technically worked.  I now fill this 40 oz. Tumbler with ice and water, and then promptly stir in a couple of water enhancers packets.  It doesn't take long g for that to disappear and I refill it with cold water, still having plenty of ice for the next two packets.  At this rate I may need to consider buying stock in some water enhancement supplement companies.I have discovered the slight \"ting-ting\" of ice vestiges in this tumbler when picking it up to wash and refill it on more than one occasion now.  I am seriously impressed.I got my husband one too and he loves it on his night stand keeping an ample supply of icy water within reach all night long.I have been skeptical about all the fuss about these tumblers.  Until now.  My husband LOVES his and has said so several times now - which is just a mind-blowing thing for him to say.Great build quality.  I love that is is so easy to get neat accessories/parts.These make coveted gifts!Extremely recommended.\n\nI didn’t know a water cup could make me this excited, but here we are. This pink Stanley Quencher H2.0 has handles, which basically turns me into a walking hydration superhero. I carry it everywhere, sip like a fancy caffeine-free queen, and never spill a drop.The straw is so smooth it makes drinking water feel fancy, like I’m in a high-end cafe… except it’s just me at my desk, pretending I’m very productive. And yes, it holds enough water that I can ignore refills for hours, hydration level: expert.If you want a cup that’s practical, sturdy, and makes you feel slightly cooler than you actually are, this is it. Bonus: it’s pink, so it’s basically a mood booster disguised as a water bottle.",

Bonus: it’s pink, so it’s basically a mood booster disguised as a water bottle.\n\nI’m a big fan of Stanley cups because they help me drink the minimum amount of water I need every day — and that’s not easy when life gets busy. The best part is that it keeps my water super cold for hours, which makes drinking water way more enjoyable.I chose this darker color after having a lighter Stanley that looked dirty all the time. Since I usually leave my cup on the floor or take it everywhere, the light one got stained really quickly. I’ve been using this one for over a month now, and the color is perfect — it hides any marks and still looks brand new.If you need motivation to drink more water and want something that holds up in everyday life, this is it!\n\nI didn't want to buy a Stanley and be part of the \"trend\" crowd but man, I just couldn't remember to drag a plastic water bottle around with me so here I go, I bought a Stanley. When I received it, I expected the same thing, I'd forget it existed in a couple of days but nope. I don't know if it's the weight, the good quality, the straw, or how comfortable it is to carry. It stays cold, too, so that removes my room temperature water sensory issue. So, I'm a Stanley user now and I don't regret it.\n\nGreat no complaints other than handle is not welded to the cup. My previous handle came off which is why I’m replacing it after 3 years of daily use. ZERO scratches, no leaks, ice holds for entire work shift and coffee hot for hours, lid never had issues, and IT FITS EVERY CUP HOLDER!!!Helped me drink more water in a day, four refills is a gallon so I use that to track how much water I drink instead of using a tracker or an app worked very well for me.Only complaint is the handle but this cup is definitely worth the hype\n\nEl vaso STANLEY Quencher H2.0 con asa y pitillo es como el guardián de tus bebidas: con materiales tan resistentes que parece hecho para sobrevivir a cualquier aventura, desde el calor del trópico hasta el frío de la montaña. Su magia está en que conserva la temperatura como si fuera un hechizo, manteniendo tus bebidas frías o calientes exactamente como las quieres, sin que el tiempo ni el ambiente se metan en el asunto. Y el color, ¡ah!, es tan adecuado que combina con todo, como si el vaso supiera vestirse para cada ocasión. En resumen, un compañero de viaje que no solo aguanta todo, sino que también te hace sentir como un explorador con estilo en cada sorbo.\n\nI never understood the big deal with this tumbler until I got one. It is the best glass for home and travel. I chose a color that was considered out if season so it was much more affordable. Ice stays frozen overnight. I don't use the straw, I just drink out of the lid which is nice and thin, unlike other brands I've tried where the mouth area is just too much. I carry this glass with my day and night since it just holds the best drinking water.",

I am very happy with the purchase and actually love this 20 oz Stanley cup. It is the perfect size for me and I am already drinking more water every day because I enjoy drinking out of it.

Literally my ice water last for a couple days in terms of the ice not melting. So, while I do not need another large tumbler, I would highly recommend to others to get a Stanley brand tumbler rather than a knockoff tumbler. I also really like that when I do close the lid in such a way that I don't have the straw in and the mouth area is covered, it really doesn't leak if I place it in my bag. That has been awesome. Oh, something that I do to make cleaning easier is I do not use the reusable straw. I ordered a bunch of large straws so that I can just use it and then throw it away and not have to deal with cleaning a straw.",

My previous handle came off which is why I’m replacing it after 3 years of daily use. ZERO scratches, no leaks, ice holds for entire work shift and coffee hot for hours, lid never had issues, and IT FITS EVERY CUP HOLDER!!!Helped me drink more water in a day, four refills is a gallon so I use that to track how much water I drink instead of using a tracker or an app worked very well for me.Only complaint is the handle but this cup is definitely worth the hype\n\nEl vaso STANLEY Quencher H2.0 con asa y pitillo es como el guardián de tus bebidas: con materiales tan resistentes que parece hecho para sobrevivir a cualquier aventura, desde el calor del trópico hasta el frío de la montaña. Su magia está en que conserva la temperatura como si fuera un hechizo, manteniendo tus bebidas frías o calientes exactamente como las quieres, sin que el tiempo ni el ambiente se metan en el asunto.

En resumen, un compañero de viaje que no solo aguanta todo, sino que también te hace sentir como un explorador con estilo en cada sorbo.\n\nI never understood the big deal with this tumbler until I got one. It is the best glass for home and travel. I chose a color that was considered out if season so it was much more affordable. Ice stays frozen overnight. I don't use the straw, I just drink out of the lid which is nice and thin, unlike other brands I've tried where the mouth area is just too much. I carry this glass with my day and night since it just holds the best drinking water.\n\nI have to say that I was against spending this much for a drinking cup. I am very happy with the purchase and actually love this 20 oz Stanley cup. It is the perfect size for me and I am already drinking more water every day because I enjoy drinking out of it. It keeps my water cold all day, and is easy to keep clean because every piece of the lid comes apart and goes back together easily. Love, love, love it!",

Love, love, love it!\n\nShortly after purchasing this, I was told this was actually a popular brand, to which I had no idea of its reputation before. After using it every day since then, I can absolutely see why. It's incredible how well this keeps a consistent temperature in spite of how hot it gets on my daily commutes for over an entire day. The handle is also very comfortable to hold, and I appreciate how the top's position is reversible depending on whether I want to hold it with my left or right hand. The size of the mug is perfect for how much I sip on coldbrew throughout the day, and feels stable enough to not knock over easily in most circumstances.The only problem I have had so far is that if tipped over too far, your beverage can still spill through the seal on top even though it looks like it's completely covered.

Love, love, love it!\n\nThe only reason I gave it a three-star rating is not due to the quality of the product.Stanley is the best value, offering high-quality products that keep ice in drinks for up to two days straight. I love Stanley. They are easy to clean and superior with no spillage, and they keep drinks cold for a long time.I am disabled and received a 30oz tumbler and not the 40oz I ORDERED. I am not pleased at all. I do not mean to sound like such a Karren, however when you are severely disabled and do not want to depend on others to do the most simplistic of tasks for you... Up to and including returns, it is about dignity and correctness with delivery.However, the cup is beautiful and of course superior quality.\n\nI ordered this last spring, but did not open the box until school started this year - I am a teacher - I was saving it for this school year. All of my colleagues and students love the Stanley brand. I had to throw mine out. The top part of the handle came off. We tried super glue, but that didn’t hold. Then the bottom part of the handle came loose! I wanted to love this product, but the handle issue was too much. I figure it is way past the return date. So I chucked it. On the bright side,  ice retention was fabulous.\n\nThe tumbler is great but when I opened it, it had a price tag on the bottom $5.00 less than what I had paid (MSRP $20.00) feeling like I got ripped off because I bought it for $25.00. Our 8 year old is obsessed with this tumbler though, stays cold all day. 14 oz is perfect for the young ones. Took me a while to figure out the lid has to be screwed on in the right position for it to be right handed, she didn’t know how to hold it but we figured it out eventually.",

Took me a while to figure out the lid has to be screwed on in the right position for it to be right handed, she didn’t know how to hold it but we figured it out eventually.\n\nI was surprised to see how it came. I us to have 2 Stanley growlers long before they became an obsession for everyone. I absolutely LOVED it and how durable they are...but I don't remember receiving them loose inside an Amazon box. If Stanley charges SO MUCH and is making such a killing, the LEAST they can do is sell their product in some cardboard packaging that holds everything in position,maybe protects the straw? I guess it might not be necessary if it's still as badass as they once were??? Idk now. Maybe they became too popular and care/quality went down? I hope not. I was excited to replace my Iron flask bottle of a similar color because the lid of the straw top cracked.....and (ironically) the IronFlask (°F) was BETTER packaged in a nice box with extra stuff.....maybe I should have gotten another IronFlask 🙄😒 but maybe a this purchase is still better. Time will tell.\n\nI ordered 2 of these as gifts. One is in a box and one is wrapped in plastic for same family. I contacted Stanley just for a box but heard nothing back. I contacted them a second time and was told no, they would not send a box partly because they are being environmentally responsible, also it’s only an inconvenience for me. ! So plastic wrap is better than a box?\n\nIs great because it keeps any liquids cold like for 2 days. But it scratches and get dent really easy. It feel down and the handle broke off. Needs to be stronger in the outside.\n\nMy daughter loves Stanley so I bought her this. The top started leaking badly about 2 weeks in. And she was very careful of this cup.  Not impressed with cover but the cup held up well. If you buy male sure to get replacement covers in case.\n\nno straw. Very poor Stanley Customer Service- contacted Stanley’s phone number (get the number from this Amazon listing), after waiting for a real person on the phone, they don’t handle tumblers, only handle equipment. The Stanley representative gave me a one 800 number,to get a straw. It ended up being a one 800 number for a Medicare insurance…. Unable to get Amazon Customer Service. Sending 1 Tumblr back. Having to pay for straw….\n\nLove it overall, especially the color, however it arrived scratched up with a gunky substance on it. The handle is really scratched, has a large scratch on the bottom, and a big chunk of color missing on the bottom. Definitely doesn't feel like a new tumbler.\n\nThis is a lovely cup; my daughter particularly enjoyed the color. However, it does tend to spill if knocked over. While I appreciate that it maintains the temperature of ice water, the ice does melt within a few hours. The product description claims ice lasts for days, but we have not found this to be accurate. Nevertheless, the cup effectively keeps drinks cold for the duration needed.",
