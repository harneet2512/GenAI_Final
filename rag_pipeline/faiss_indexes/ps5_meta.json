MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

I have such a fun time playing phasmophobia and other games with my friends :) the quality of the system itself is stellar as far as I've seen. The load times are great, the variety of games are lovely, and the remote is equipped with a built in microphone, making headphones completely optional! While I am more of an XBOX girlie, all of my games were on PS4. PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!",

PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!\n\nStraight to the point - PS5 Pro is going to benefit the games that are tailored, by Sony / other developers, to utilize the PSSR enhancing feature. When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games. If this happens, PlayStation will break the internet!\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro takes gaming to the next level with ultra-sharp 4K visuals, smoother frame rates and stunning ray tracing. The PSSR AI enhancement makes games look incredible, and the 2TB SSD gives plenty of storage. It’s sleek, quiet, and feels premium.

But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

I have such a fun time playing phasmophobia and other games with my friends :) the quality of the system itself is stellar as far as I've seen. The load times are great, the variety of games are lovely, and the remote is equipped with a built in microphone, making headphones completely optional!

When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games. If this happens, PlayStation will break the internet!\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro takes gaming to the next level with ultra-sharp 4K visuals, smoother frame rates and stunning ray tracing.

But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.\n\nIn every ounce of the name \"PS5 Pro,\" this console is exactly that, yet it feels underwhelming despite it. I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.\n\nDay 1 Review so far:Setup: PS5 Pro, LG C3 4k HDR 120Hz OLED TV, HDMI 2.1 cable, iFi Zen Dac V3.Game(s) tested so far: Stellar Blade & Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Since they have an update specifically for the PS5 Pro)Graphical Upgrade (Varied by games) - ★ ★ ★ ★Performance Upgrade - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Noise & Cooling - ★ ★ ★Consumer Friendliness (No Disc Drive or Stand included) - ★Price & Value: ★TD:LR & Final Verdict: If you're happy with the base PS5, just wait. But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I got it about a day after launch day in 2013 and have been using it since then.The PS5? Couldn't get it. It was scalped to death and couldn't find it anywhere and if you could find it, good luck paying retail price for it.It's been 5 years since then, and now Sony has released the PS5 Pro. In the 12 year gap between consoles, the pro model was made to introduce mid-console life improvements to the platform, and other various optimizations.So are the changes worth it?Depends... Do you have a 4K TV? Is that TV capable of a 120hz refresh rate? if the answer to at least one of those two questions is yes, then... yeah you will SLIGHT improvement in graphical quality. But in all honesty, the bigger advantage is the 120hz refresh rate support. Games will look and run smoother because of it, depends on the game for the most part.Now, about the lack of disc drive. Do you care about Physical media enough to want the disc reader? Probably, but... it would've been great if you just included it like it was in the base model of PS5. Or at least offer a version that includes it. The price of the PRO model is already 35% higher than the standard model. It's just an unnecessary deduction in what would've been a complete package.Conclusion: If you already have the PS5(of any model), there is very little justification in getting this model. If you don't have a 4k TV or a display capable of 120hz refresh rate then don't waste your money - the base/slim model of PS5 is more than enough to game on.\n\nWe recently upgraded from the PS4 to the PS5 and while the performance and graphics are undeniably impressive, we ran into an unexpected issue: our favorite headphones are no longer compatible. The PS5 uses a different plug-in setup than the PS4, which means we’ll have to retire our trusted headset and invest in a new one.It’s a bit disappointing, especially since the headphones still work perfectly. This experience highlights a broader point—when you upgrade your console, you may also need to upgrade your accessories. It’s something to keep in mind if you're planning the switch.Overall, the PS5 is a solid upgrade, but be prepared for some extra costs beyond just the console itself.",

I will begin to list here: limiting games on home screen to 5..you have to go into game library to open games, if you wana play anything that you have installed on it you have to scroll right and then open the library then scroll down to search for it. This used used to an option on ps4 but now on ps5 it is the only option and it is a far less pleasing process. Next. it has no web browser. Next. I dont like the controller much, it just fatigues my hands much more quickly than the ds4 and I just dont appreciate the idea than i dont have different options. it feels poorly. Next. the shape is quite inneficent doesnt matter much but it is quite lacking in utility. Next. Bad coil whine. Ive had two ps5s now and can say they all had far worse ellectronic buzz and rattling noise compared to my ps4 and ps3 soley because of the cheap electronics parts sony uses on their psu arent quite of the same standard of yesteryear consoles or many other console systems in general. Next. Theres no option to quick shut off the system with three simple button presses like on the ps3 and ps4 instead you have to navigate several menus to shut it off. Next. Im probably missing some other things but other than that i feel that the ps5 pro is lacking in but it escapes my mind at the moment  Now. what does the ps5 pro have that the ps4 doesnt have? Two things. Frame rate and a small pool of exclusive games. Other than that it will feel a total downgrade from the ps4 in every way, and it is.",

Everything inside seems correct and the system functions as it should. Though I have no clue if this was used and returned or what the situation is. The console isn't cheap, even with the $50 discount so you'd expect better. It's a significant process for me to return this, so I guess I'll keep it for now unless something happens before the return date.-It's still frustrating that the system is digital only and requires a separate disc drive to function properly. No one wants a more expensive model of a console just so they have to buy all their old games again from their digital store. If they are remastered versions, fine, but most don't have that.-The system doesn't prioritize highspeed bandwidth, I have a triple band router that sends out 2.4, 5, and 6ghz. Console is designed to take all three bandwidths, you'd expect it to use the strongest signal and highest speeds. It would choose 2.4ghz every time, the router is less than five feet away and has very low traffic on the 6ghz band with a 2GB internet package, so there's no reason it should prioritize the 2.4 band. Had to manually change the priority on the console to 6ghz and now it works fine, if I didn't know how to do this I would be irate with the performance. Went to download some things and one game update said it would take over four hours to complete, downloading at under 20mbs. Can't have that when so many games and updates are massive data packages.The good so far.-Games run flawlessly from what I've seen so far. Have a TV that allows 120hz, so the framerate for the titles look great.-Played a couple 4k films and they looked great as well. No issues with motion or blurred movement, no drop in quality and the films definitely look like 4k resolution unlike streaming \"4k\" films and shows. Though the controls using the controller aren't exactly intuitive when trying to use the menus.\n\nSo far the unit works good.  They will not let me reset my password. On my email that I set up when PlayStation started  going online. With out having info that no one will have after over ten years so they told me to make a new email address  to use the game pass.\n\nThe console was awesome while it lasted. After only a year and a half, it is getting completely overheated without playing for 5 minutes. My husband had a PS4 over 10 years and never had this problem. Very disappointing to have this problem when it costs so much.\n\nAs for the playing game, it is good.The inconvenience is (1) it copies the game before I can play, so have to wait 20-40 minutes, (2) but, i still have to insert the disc to play any game, why?  (3) the system is slow to start, (4) it seems requiring the internet all the time.As an off-line gamer, this is probably an over-kill unless you want some PS5 specific games.\n\nGarbage hdmi sturdiness, there needs to be 2-3 hdmis minimum, hdmi stopped working for ps4 too, and had to get an xbox series s which its hdmi is still working…",

MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

I have such a fun time playing phasmophobia and other games with my friends :) the quality of the system itself is stellar as far as I've seen. The load times are great, the variety of games are lovely, and the remote is equipped with a built in microphone, making headphones completely optional!

While I am more of an XBOX girlie, all of my games were on PS4. PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!\n\nStraight to the point - PS5 Pro is going to benefit the games that are tailored, by Sony / other developers, to utilize the PSSR enhancing feature. When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games. If this happens, PlayStation will break the internet!\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro takes gaming to the next level with ultra-sharp 4K visuals, smoother frame rates and stunning ray tracing. The PSSR AI enhancement makes games look incredible, and the 2TB SSD gives plenty of storage. It’s sleek, quiet, and feels premium. Delivery was quick and packaging perfect.✅ Amazing graphics & performance✅ Smooth gameplay✅ Big 2TB storage✅ Fast delivery❌ No disc drive (digital-only)Overall, an absolute powerhouse worth every penny for serious gamers!\n\nCame as shown without any damages on it because of how well the seller packaged it. The gaming console works incredibly well, didn't have any issues with it whatsoever. I'm really glad to have bought it from this seller.\n\nSince I set up my PS5 Pro, the difference is clear — games load incredibly fast, the graphics look sharper and more detailed, and everything runs super smooth. The improved visuals, lighting, and reflections make the experience feel almost cinematic. If you have a 4K TV (or plan to get one), this console is ready to blow your mind. It’s also great that it stays compatible with my previous accessories. It’s a bit pricey, but if you value power, speed, and a premium gaming experience, it’s absolutely worth it.",

MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.

Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

It’s a bit pricey, but if you value power, speed, and a premium gaming experience, it’s absolutely worth it.\n\nIt's really hard to describe, but in games that do not have a PlayStation five pro patch it enhances them by stabilizing the frames, cleaning up a lot of the artifacts and slowdowns that were present before they're no longer there the image and everything is just completely clean. MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

I have such a fun time playing phasmophobia and other games with my friends :) the quality of the system itself is stellar as far as I've seen. The load times are great, the variety of games are lovely, and the remote is equipped with a built in microphone, making headphones completely optional!

While I am more of an XBOX girlie, all of my games were on PS4. PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!\n\nStraight to the point - PS5 Pro is going to benefit the games that are tailored, by Sony / other developers, to utilize the PSSR enhancing feature. When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games. If this happens, PlayStation will break the internet!\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro takes gaming to the next level with ultra-sharp 4K visuals, smoother frame rates and stunning ray tracing. The PSSR AI enhancement makes games look incredible, and the 2TB SSD gives plenty of storage. It’s sleek, quiet, and feels premium. Delivery was quick and packaging perfect.✅ Amazing graphics & performance✅ Smooth gameplay✅ Big 2TB storage✅ Fast delivery❌ No disc drive (digital-only)Overall, an absolute powerhouse worth every penny for serious gamers!\n\nCame as shown without any damages on it because of how well the seller packaged it. The gaming console works incredibly well, didn't have any issues with it whatsoever. I'm really glad to have bought it from this seller.\n\nSince I set up my PS5 Pro, the difference is clear — games load incredibly fast, the graphics look sharper and more detailed, and everything runs super smooth. The improved visuals, lighting, and reflections make the experience feel almost cinematic. If you have a 4K TV (or plan to get one), this console is ready to blow your mind. It’s also great that it stays compatible with my previous accessories. It’s a bit pricey, but if you value power, speed, and a premium gaming experience, it’s absolutely worth it.",

It’s a bit pricey, but if you value power, speed, and a premium gaming experience, it’s absolutely worth it.\n\nIt's really hard to describe, but in games that do not have a PlayStation five pro patch it enhances them by stabilizing the frames, cleaning up a lot of the artifacts and slowdowns that were present before they're no longer there the image and everything is just completely clean. MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home.

They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

It’s a bit pricey, but if you value power, speed, and a premium gaming experience, it’s absolutely worth it.\n\nIt's really hard to describe, but in games that do not have a PlayStation five pro patch it enhances them by stabilizing the frames, cleaning up a lot of the artifacts and slowdowns that were present before they're no longer there the image and everything is just completely clean. MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!\n\nStraight to the point - PS5 Pro is going to benefit the games that are tailored, by Sony / other developers, to utilize the PSSR enhancing feature. When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games. If this happens, PlayStation will break the internet!\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro takes gaming to the next level with ultra-sharp 4K visuals, smoother frame rates and stunning ray tracing.

Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!\n\nStraight to the point - PS5 Pro is going to benefit the games that are tailored, by Sony / other developers, to utilize the PSSR enhancing feature. When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games.

Delivery was quick and packaging perfect.✅ Amazing graphics & performance✅ Smooth gameplay✅ Big 2TB storage✅ Fast delivery❌ No disc drive (digital-only)Overall, an absolute powerhouse worth every penny for serious gamers!\n\nDay 1 Review so far:Setup: PS5 Pro, LG C3 4k HDR 120Hz OLED TV, HDMI 2.1 cable, iFi Zen Dac V3.Game(s) tested so far: Stellar Blade & Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Since they have an update specifically for the PS5 Pro)Graphical Upgrade (Varied by games) - ★ ★ ★ ★Performance Upgrade - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Noise & Cooling - ★ ★ ★Consumer Friendliness (No Disc Drive or Stand included) - ★Price & Value: ★TD:LR & Final Verdict: If you're happy with the base PS5, just wait. But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

MK one for example is getting a patch, but I played it before the patch and after the new system, there's no frame drops, slow downs or weird stuttering. Everything is just more solid. Of course it'll only get better once they patch it.Stellar Blade is MUCH more cleaner with patch. I also noticed the details, obviously because of the pro patch but the game runs solid and very fluid. It's like a completely different game. I normally played game in 4K, but I had to drop down to performance mode on the original PS5 and it looked a little grainy, even with the 4K option on and you sit still and look into the distance. There was strange type of grain/artifacts. All that is completely gone now with Pro/Patched. The high frame and the good graphics are basically combining into one down. Even an option to play 120 Hz. (if into that)After the PS five pro patch games  are a completely different animal, night and day. Crystal clear fluid higher frame rate and the resolution is just incredible. Everything is much more cleaner, no artifacts or weird strange noise in the background. It's just clean it almost wants you to get closer to the television.  Of course the bigger TV is really benefited from at the most I would say 60 and up. (I have a 82)As for the non-PlayStation 5 pro has games they just run more smoothly, load quicker, no studder, and overall everything is just solid. It's really hard to explain now I know what some people were talking about saying that it's very hard to describe. It's one of those things you have to have inside your house. He won't really notice a lot of of the details on a standard YouTube video or small handheld cell phone. You have to have the unit in your home. If I'm not mistaken, PlayStation five pro enhancements now after it's released was encouraged and should be simple for the developers to turn on as the games being made.Either way i'd recommended it, very happy with it. It feels like this should've been the unit that came out originally back with the original PS five released. The lighting and reflection is far more noticeable like at least 2 to 3 times more detail. It's in your face versus before barely noticeable now it's just there and it looks really good when you see it in movement. Now some people may think is that worth it? Yes because between graphics, reflections, and real time light and animations and everything included and games nowadays when everything is performing on equal level, the experience is better.Games that are not patched seemed to run at a higher or more stable frame rate, which is something you physically notice. I tried devil may cry for the PlayStation five reflections look the same just more smoother. Not as real looking since its a release game when the Pro model wasn't available.Games that take advantage of the more realistic reflections and better lighting have to be patched, but luckily the game ends up being more smoother feeling, frame drops are no longer a thing. Either way, old game would perform better. It also has an option to boost older games going all the way back to the PlayStation 4. I haven't tried it since I don't have any PS4 games, but from what I've read, it's sharpens and cleans up a lot of the images even on games that were not patched.I'll give you a tip with the 120 Hz. Sony does not have a full high speed. It's cap the 32 something they can possibly unlock later in the future. HDR data never output full in a game that runs at 120hz, and it's been that way since the original PlayStation 5. If you use 120 Hz and you have a 120 Hz TV the image will look darker. You can fix this by turning on HIGI in settings, (should be under tone mapping) or option in some tv that have game mode. In other TVs, it only appeared after turning on game mode.But there's a workaround to force the system to output full color, which ends up being super bright. Change the setting for that specific game to 1080p by force in the PS5 Pro/PS5 system menu. However, I would recommend this more for the PRO because it has enhancement with a brand new 4K scaling system. Set the game to either fidelity on the P55 PRO mode or Pro Max try them both out you'll notice the darkness goes instantly away because the HDMI now has less information to output so we can output full color resolution @120hz. Or you can just not play in 120 Hz and just use a standard Pro setting/leave system at 2k. Just giving a tip in case you try 120 Hz and realize it's darker.I'm happy with the unit. It does feel like a completely different system. It's just overall better performance, more cleaner, the pro enhanced games look freaking phenomenal and it definitely fixes a lot of problems with the older non-pro games.",

Four years is a LONG time to wait to play a new R&C title, after all!So here are my thoughts on the PS5, now that's in my house:1) Setup is remarkably easy, including wirelessly transferring game save information from a PS4. It did take me a while to figure out how to turn off the female voice heralding all my actions (under Accessibility options).2) The PS5 runs like a champ. So far, I have not been aware of any fan noises or clouds of warm air exhaust spewing out.3) The DualSense controllers had weaker rumble than I expected. It turns out that the rumble motors default to the \"weak\" setting if you have the controller's microphone enabled. I turned off the mike, and the rumble was back at full force, but with more finesse than that experienced with the PS4's DUALSHOCK controllers. If I'm not mistaken, the precision of the DS controller actually seems to improve my game scores...4) The new user interface is kind of a mess. In particular, leaving the POWER button off the Home page was a boneheaded move. One of my first issues with the new console was -- how do I turn this bloody beast OFF??? I wish that the controller battery gauge was on the Home page as well.5) It was a brilliant idea making the disk drive detachable. The one problem I had with my PS4 involved the machine's failure to read disks after a few years, which I am guessing was an issue of a dirty reading head; I sent the console to Sony to be fixed, and it came back working perfectly in one week. Now I assume I can just repair or replace the removable drive without sending in the entire console for repair...6) Now that the PS5 packs 1 TB of memory, I was wondering how soon I would need to add more memory. Currently, I have plenty of memory to switch back and forth between a number of games, including Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart, plus several from the PS4, including WRC Generations, Far Cry 6, and Resident Evil 4, as well as the Pinball Arcade. One good reason I wanted the disk version of the PS5 was to minimize the size of game downloads to preserve memory.7) The audio/video performance of the PS5 to play back DVD's and Blu-Rays is outstanding. And I was happy to find that the excellent Bluetooth PDP media controller I got for the PS4 works with the PS5 as well. Yea -- that made me feel better about spending $30 for the PS5's vertical stand instead!8) And some of the PS5 titles are FINALLY coming down in price: Rift Apart and the latest Star Wars game, for example -- two AAA titles -- are now available for a far more affordable $30.So if you have been putting off upgrading to a PS5, it may be time at last to make the move, provided you can catch a special promotion.And to those who say, \"Game consoles' days are numbered,\" I say -- as long as many of us prefer to play games sitting on a couch, enveloped in booming 3D sound and watching our dazzling big-screen TV's  -- long live PlayStation consoles -- especially those that serve as a 2-in-1 machine, with built-in (or detachable) disk drives that also play DVD's and BR's!",

PS5 did not disappoint whatsoever though regardless!\n\nStraight to the point - PS5 Pro is going to benefit the games that are tailored, by Sony / other developers, to utilize the PSSR enhancing feature. When that Pro enhancement exists, you can expect a near / at 60 FPS for the game using this feature. Prime point, Star Wars: Outlaws; it's pro performance mode now incorporates the Fidelity Mode of the base PS5 while boosting the FPS to 60 - it's noticeable and if your TV or chose Gaming Monitor has the appropriate specs for Variable Refresh Rate (up to 120hz), then you're getting even more out of the Pro.As someone who is using their Pro as an extension of what I play on my rather robust PC (RTX 4090), it's nice to go into the living room and have my eyes not experience a jarring Technological Friction with way lower FPS than what I am accustomed to gaming with on my PC. Yes, this is a first world problem, yes, I have immense gratitude for the PC I own and now PS5 Pro, and for folks who want more consistent performance, then the PS5 Pro is phenomenal.Here's the catch, and all buyers looking to get one, PLEASE be aware: All games are NOT going to benefit from the PS5 Pro right out of the box. They have to be patched and or tailor-made upon release to utilize the features of this system. As of this writing there are a number of titles that benefit from said Pro / PSSR enhancements, but you have to research and make sure those are games you currently own.Take Cyberpunk 2077 on PS5; CDPR have chose not to (as of this writing) to craft a PS5 Pro enhanced mode for the game. When you boot it up, the Fidelity (ray trace mode) still runs at a jarringly low framerate. Performance mode still has the FASTER framerate everyone has been accustomed to. It's this kind of example that folks, myself included, temper their expectations with currently until more titles are released using the PSSR feature to boost FPS in more graphically demanding games.As someone who plays Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with an RTX 4090 and further enhancements being provided by Nvidia's DLSS, my frames are above 200 FPS and higher; it's kind of wild - yes, I could be playing at 1440p / 4k, but having everything maxed out with Path Tracing on (which is being boosted by DLSS) is truly a sight to behold, even at 1080p on a 25 inch monitor with proper Gsync (Viewsonic Elite XG251G - 25 inch - 1080- 1 Ms - 360Hx - with Gysnc).Coming from this to the PS5 Pro is a night and day comparison, but again, at basic performance mode the game is running at 60 FPS; would it be nice if CDPR added a PS5 Pro patch, yes, but again, unless it is advertised as such, your game is not taking advantage of the price you're paying to get this shinier system.Which brings me to the end - is the PS5 Pro absolutely necessary at this point, NO, not at all. You're buying the system now as a way to boost the games you have that are advertised to be taking advantage of the Pro with a \"Pro\" Enhanced mode - again, research the game you are playing and see if it does. On top of this, it's for what's to come in the 2025 and beyond as we get closer to PS6. The hope is PSSR will boost games that are robust and will need the added bit of horsepower the Pro can afford on top of the aforementioned PSS5 boost. Think Grand Theft Auto 6; that game is going to be BEEFY and even on PS5 Pro I anticipate the FPS is going to struggle so any added boost, such as that from PSSR, will probably move more people to consider a mid-gen upgrade like this. While not necessary, hopefully Sony learns to competitively price this system in a way that doesn't feel so OBSCENE as it does now.I sold my OG PS5 Digital and utilized some gift money I happened upon this holiday season; if it wasn't for that, I would not have bothered to buy the Pro. For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!",

For the games I play currently that benefit from the Pro / PSSR enhancement, it's great (SW:Outlaws; Horizon Remastered; Hogwarts Legacy; Alan Wake II).If you get one, enjoy, if you don't that's cool too!\n\nPeople complaining about this being 700 or I guess 750 now cuz of you know the economy but at the same time the PS5 when it first came out 5 years ago during covid was still 500 dollars. The graphical upgrade the Fidelity the size of it all worth it. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that I had to buy this drive but it was only 70 bucks so it wasn't really that big of a deal. So I can still get disk games and 4k blurays. You dont need it but its a nice to have the menus are faster and games are nicer. It does run a lot hotter in games like ghost or Yotei so rememeber that and sure it had good ventilation and away from the wall and not in a cubby hole or you will shorten the life of your ps5 or any electrical device. One minor thing I wish you could do is increase your fan speed cause like said she does get warm with the equivalent 3070 video card in it from the equivalent that was in the ps5.\n\nI bought this as an early Christmas and late Birthday gift for a friend. He loves it. The resolution is amazing and he's totally enjoying it more than his X-Box! He says there are some better games for him to enjoy.\n\nI am surprised on how extremely crisp, sharper, and detailed the graphics and FPS are on the PS5 PRO! Now, I'm waiting for the 2026 BIG fidelity improvements that supposed to jump the PS5 Pro's graphics from 60fps at 4k to a locked 120fps at 4k for certain games. If this happens, PlayStation will break the internet!\n\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro takes gaming to the next level with ultra-sharp 4K visuals, smoother frame rates and stunning ray tracing. The PSSR AI enhancement makes games look incredible, and the 2TB SSD gives plenty of storage. It’s sleek, quiet, and feels premium. Delivery was quick and packaging perfect.✅ Amazing graphics & performance✅ Smooth gameplay✅ Big 2TB storage✅ Fast delivery❌ No disc drive (digital-only)Overall, an absolute powerhouse worth every penny for serious gamers!",

Delivery was quick and packaging perfect.✅ Amazing graphics & performance✅ Smooth gameplay✅ Big 2TB storage✅ Fast delivery❌ No disc drive (digital-only)Overall, an absolute powerhouse worth every penny for serious gamers!\n\nDay 1 Review so far:Setup: PS5 Pro, LG C3 4k HDR 120Hz OLED TV, HDMI 2.1 cable, iFi Zen Dac V3.Game(s) tested so far: Stellar Blade & Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Since they have an update specifically for the PS5 Pro)Graphical Upgrade (Varied by games) - ★ ★ ★ ★Performance Upgrade - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Noise & Cooling - ★ ★ ★Consumer Friendliness (No Disc Drive or Stand included) - ★Price & Value: ★TD:LR & Final Verdict: If you're happy with the base PS5, just wait. But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

I got it about a day after launch day in 2013 and have been using it since then.The PS5? Couldn't get it. It was scalped to death and couldn't find it anywhere and if you could find it, good luck paying retail price for it.It's been 5 years since then, and now Sony has released the PS5 Pro. In the 12 year gap between consoles, the pro model was made to introduce mid-console life improvements to the platform, and other various optimizations.So are the changes worth it?Depends... Do you have a 4K TV? Is that TV capable of a 120hz refresh rate? if the answer to at least one of those two questions is yes, then... yeah you will SLIGHT improvement in graphical quality. But in all honesty, the bigger advantage is the 120hz refresh rate support. Games will look and run smoother because of it, depends on the game for the most part.Now, about the lack of disc drive. Do you care about Physical media enough to want the disc reader? Probably, but... it would've been great if you just included it like it was in the base model of PS5. Or at least offer a version that includes it. The price of the PRO model is already 35% higher than the standard model. It's just an unnecessary deduction in what would've been a complete package.Conclusion: If you already have the PS5(of any model), there is very little justification in getting this model. If you don't have a 4k TV or a display capable of 120hz refresh rate then don't waste your money - the base/slim model of PS5 is more than enough to game on.\n\nWe recently upgraded from the PS4 to the PS5 and while the performance and graphics are undeniably impressive, we ran into an unexpected issue: our favorite headphones are no longer compatible. The PS5 uses a different plug-in setup than the PS4, which means we’ll have to retire our trusted headset and invest in a new one.It’s a bit disappointing, especially since the headphones still work perfectly.

Two things. Frame rate and a small pool of exclusive games. Other than that it will feel a total downgrade from the ps4 in every way, and it is.\n\nGood system so far.Want to get the cons out of the way first and the first is a major one.-When I received the console, the seal had already been broken and considering the condition of the tape, it was a while ago. Everything inside seems correct and the system functions as it should. Though I have no clue if this was used and returned or what the situation is. The console isn't cheap, even with the $50 discount so you'd expect better. It's a significant process for me to return this, so I guess I'll keep it for now unless something happens before the return date.-It's still frustrating that the system is digital only and requires a separate disc drive to function properly. No one wants a more expensive model of a console just so they have to buy all their old games again from their digital store. If they are remastered versions, fine, but most don't have that.-The system doesn't prioritize highspeed bandwidth, I have a triple band router that sends out 2.4, 5, and 6ghz. Console is designed to take all three bandwidths, you'd expect it to use the strongest signal and highest speeds. It would choose 2.4ghz every time, the router is less than five feet away and has very low traffic on the 6ghz band with a 2GB internet package, so there's no reason it should prioritize the 2.4 band. Had to manually change the priority on the console to 6ghz and now it works fine, if I didn't know how to do this I would be irate with the performance. Went to download some things and one game update said it would take over four hours to complete, downloading at under 20mbs. Can't have that when so many games and updates are massive data packages.The good so far.-Games run flawlessly from what I've seen so far. Have a TV that allows 120hz, so the framerate for the titles look great.-Played a couple 4k films and they looked great as well. No issues with motion or blurred movement, no drop in quality and the films definitely look like 4k resolution unlike streaming \"4k\" films and shows. Though the controls using the controller aren't exactly intuitive when trying to use the menus.\n\nSo far the unit works good.  They will not let me reset my password. On my email that I set up when PlayStation started  going online. With out having info that no one will have after over ten years so they told me to make a new email address  to use the game pass.\n\nThe console was awesome while it lasted. After only a year and a half, it is getting completely overheated without playing for 5 minutes. My husband had a PS4 over 10 years and never had this problem. Very disappointing to have this problem when it costs so much.\n\nAs for the playing game, it is good.The inconvenience is (1) it copies the game before I can play, so have to wait 20-40 minutes, (2) but, i still have to insert the disc to play any game, why?  (3) the system is slow to start, (4) it seems requiring the internet all the time.As an off-line gamer, this is probably an over-kill unless you want some PS5 specific games.\n\nGarbage hdmi sturdiness, there needs to be 2-3 hdmis minimum, hdmi stopped working for ps4 too, and had to get an xbox series s which its hdmi is still working…",

But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

I got it about a day after launch day in 2013 and have been using it since then.The PS5? Couldn't get it. It was scalped to death and couldn't find it anywhere and if you could find it, good luck paying retail price for it.It's been 5 years since then, and now Sony has released the PS5 Pro. In the 12 year gap between consoles, the pro model was made to introduce mid-console life improvements to the platform, and other various optimizations.So are the changes worth it?Depends...

But if you're an enthusiast and have the right equipment setup like 4k HDR 120Hz TV and games that are currently supported, then go for it, you'll notice an improvement. To begin with, if you're looking for a massive visual upgrade, at least existing PS5 games, you'll be disappointed. However, it does indeed make things look sharper and clearer while still able to maintain stable frame rate. Performance seems to be the biggest improvement, there hasn't been any lag or stutter yet, even after I run through heavy areas where I used to get lower fps, the games does seem to run very smooth, but I wouldn't say it is like upgrading from a console of 60Hz/fps gaming to 120-240Hz/fps PC gaming or anything, but it is still a noticeable improvement. The higher fps could solve ghosting issues if you experience any, I had them on the base PS5, but not on Pro, so it clearly wasn't my TV or it's settings. The PS5 Pro seems to fit previous PS5 accessories if you have any, but probably not all. Offline mode is still a possibility for those that likes to play single player games offline that doesn't require internet and PSN account. Unfortunately, that seems to be about it, there is nothing exceptional about the PS5 Pro. You're better off waiting for price drop and also for more games to get supported, what is the point of buying it now at full price if there are limited supported games. Finally, to be objectively fair, the PS5 Pro does what it says it does, but it is priced terribly, especially when you get no disc drive and stand, totaling up to $800, when the console should cost $600 at most, the cost to value is just not there. So, I can't give it 5 stars when you pay more for less, final rating is still 3/5 stars, it should get 4 stars at most, 5 star is saying it is perfect and is just preparing the PS6 for $700-800+ console gaming.For $700, you just get the console, 1 normal white PS5 controller, 2 crappy plastic stands, 2TB internal storage, the power/HDMI/USB C cables and that's it. I had to buy the disc drive separately, which cost $80, so in reality it costs $780, more if you have to buy a stand. One good piece of good news is that my previous PS5 accessories seems to fit and work with the PS5 Pro, which is the \"FASTSNAIL Cooling Fan for PS5 Slim Console\" and \"SIKEMAY PS5 Slim Stand Cooling Station for PlayStation 5 Slim Console\" and of their categories. The PS5 Pro just barely fit on the stand for the screw underneath to screw in though, but not so tight that it'd cause damage. The PS5 Pro and normal PS5 looks pretty much identical, its only the central side fins that's different. The menus and everything are still the same as the normal PS5, and that's really about it, unfortunately the PS5 Pro isn't all that impressive.The PS5 Pro isn't making any lasting impressions on me in order to keep it or really want it, maybe if they included a DualSense Edge Pro controller, that'd have been nice and more fitting. You're better off waiting for a sale if you really want the extra performance boost, since visually, I can't tell much of a difference. It is like comparing shades of the same color, there may be small improvements, but nothing noticeable that you'd react with a \"wow, that looks amazing!\". Furthermore, for those that likes to play single player games offline without the need for internet connection and PSN account, you still can, with the disc drive anyway. I'll update the review as I progress through more games, but so far, I am not sold, it is not worth the extra cost. I do not recommend it if you're thinking of upgrading from the base PS5 to the PS5 Pro. Even if you're a new buyer of a PS5, $700-800 is too much for a console that doesn't offer a significant enough of a difference, based on the games. If you run out of storage on normal PS5, you can just buy an SSD and install it yourself.Edit: After playing the PS5 Pro for a week, 11-8 to 11-15, the PS5 Pro does indeed make my games look sharper, like better anti-aliasing, sharper and smoother edges on character models, background, and objects, etc. At the same time, you get a pretty stable fps while maintaining that fidelity. That is pretty much the main selling point of the PS5 Pro, good performance with good graphics, but varied by different games. One side note I've noticed with PSSR mode is that it seems to have solved my ghosting issue on the base PS5, originally, I thought it might've been my TV, but it seems it is the console itself. So if anyone has experienced those and they bother you, the PS5 Pro could solve that issue for you. One thing I wished they improved upon was PS5's screenshot and recording modes. To be able to take screenshots at 1:1 ratio to the resolution that you play at, since they usually look at about 80% of the full quality. As for recording, you still can't have 4k replay records, the one where you can record the past 15sec to 1 hr recording, it is still stuck at 1080p. So if you want the best recording, you still have to manually record before you do whatever you're thinking of recording.Overall, the PS5 Pro is a noticeable upgrade, if you have the right setup. The main issue with it is the price, the value is just not there. How can anybody be okay with $700 console with no disc drive and stand and is also praising it with maximum rating, saying it is perfect. You're just letting Sony know you're okay with spending more for less, setting up for $700 being the future standard of console gaming. If the price keeps increasing, might as well just get a PC, since PS exclusive games are nearly all on PC by now or in the near future anyways. Furthermore, the lack of disc drive suggests it is going the digital route, while it is convenient, Sony has terrible refund policy for digital games, go google it and read it yourself if you don't believe me. They get 100% of the money even if you end up not liking the game. Which I'm not sure how anybody can know if they like the game until they try it in the first place. In comparison, you can try out the games for 2 hrs before requesting a refund on PC/Steam. In conclusion, my advice is just to wait, like many other reviews are saying, PS5 Pro is a tough sell for value. With the limited amount of games that it is supporting, it is kinda pointless to have it right now at full price if you're happy with the base PS5, wait until it is $600 or less. You're not missing out on a lot if you are already happy with the base PS5.I would recommend reading other reviews for info about more games, especially PS4 games, since not everyone has every game out there.",

I have only used the console for a few days, but it is more than enough for me to tell you; the PS5 Pro is half-baked.To start, the PS5 Pro is definitely going all-in on the Pro name. The console has 2TB of blazing fast storage, a sleek design to stand out, a faster horsepower GPU, extra RAM, and no disc drive- oh, that's not good. The PS5 Pro is no larger than the OG PS5 Disc Model, and the new console does include two small clear plastic feet to prop it on its side. Other than that, the setup is virtually identical as it includes the same white DualSense Controller, an HDMI Cable, a Power Cable, and a USB Charging Cable in the box. Once you are done setting it up, it doesn't feel any different than a normal PS5, at first.In some games, the PS5 Pro will automatically run games in Fidelity Mode at a higher base FPS, but in some, it is still limited to the locked FPS of older games. One downside is that in some games that claim to be PS5 Pro enhanced, the settings make no mention of it. For example, in Alan Wake 2, you still have a choice between Performance and Resolution modes, with no difference in description or frame rates for either. The graphics do seem to be crispier but I couldn't prove it to be honest with you. The biggest difference I noticed is the reduction in latency from controller responsiveness across most games as well as improved FPS in the Fidelity Mode for Ghost of Tsushima- but that comes at a slight cost.Other games, like Cyberpunk, which are not overtly mentioned as being Pro enhanced, do seem to run a bit snappier, as even though Cyberpunk still feels like 60 FPS on the Performance mode, it does seem like it's rendering the frames better, as if it was struggling to stay at 60 FPS on the base model PS5. I also like that the Pro gives you the option to even unlock the frame rate in some older PS4 games, as that really makes them feel like new in some instances, yet not all games support it. The Pro can even achieve 120 FPS in some games as well and when paired with a VRR compatible TV, it makes all the difference in terms of immersion. When it comes to raw power, it is better, but the elephant in the room is that most of the extra frames are not coming just from the GPU, but rather a new Pro feature called PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.PSSR is supposed to be the Pro's answer to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR upscaling techniques currently available on PC, yet I personally find it to be both a miracle worker and annoyance. PSSR is very similar to FSR in terms of this capability, yet I find some details at times to be very \"shimmery\" or \"static-like.\" For example, in Ghost of Tsushima, I mentioned that it does indeed run Fidelity mode at a higher FPS, but when turning quickly in an open area with lots of trees in the distance, you can notice the shimmering between the leaves very easily and it is almost sometimes too distracting to me. In other games, this effect is almost gone entirely and still works great at boosting FPS. So, I don't know if this is an issue with developer implementation or if it just has spotty behavior at times. Nevertheless, if it is power you want, the Pro will give it to you, but there are still other downsides.It's time we talk about the missing disc drive. For this review, it is 100% worth noting that without the drive, I cannot compare it to the disc model PS5 and instead need to compare it to the Digital Edition. In that context, the PS5 Pro is an incredibly hard pill to swallow as it is nearly double in cost. The disc drive is also nowhere in sight as there is no stock for it, which makes those who have the majority of their game library on disc unable to use it with this console until they find one. It's downright shameful, in my opinion, but I digress.In terms of game selection, the PS5 does still fully support the use of your digital library including the Game Catalog if you have the Extra or Premium tiers of PlayStation Plus. This has helped fill a bit of the void of not having a disc drive as I have been able to redownload a few of them from the catalog. The SSD also loads games just as quickly as before, and the extra storage really does help in fitting more games on the console without needing to buy an extra NVMe drive (which you can still do with the Pro if you choose).Overall, the PS5 Pro is what it says it is, and in that respect, I cannot complain. However, I do still believe that the extra storage and performance is not enough to justify its tragically inflated cost. If you want the best model possible, then you won't be too upset with Pro, but if you don't care about having the best FPS or graphics quality, then the base model PS5 will do just fine.",

I got it about a day after launch day in 2013 and have been using it since then.The PS5? Couldn't get it. It was scalped to death and couldn't find it anywhere and if you could find it, good luck paying retail price for it.It's been 5 years since then, and now Sony has released the PS5 Pro. In the 12 year gap between consoles, the pro model was made to introduce mid-console life improvements to the platform, and other various optimizations.So are the changes worth it?Depends... Do you have a 4K TV? Is that TV capable of a 120hz refresh rate? if the answer to at least one of those two questions is yes, then... yeah you will SLIGHT improvement in graphical quality. But in all honesty, the bigger advantage is the 120hz refresh rate support. Games will look and run smoother because of it, depends on the game for the most part.Now, about the lack of disc drive. Do you care about Physical media enough to want the disc reader? Probably, but... it would've been great if you just included it like it was in the base model of PS5. Or at least offer a version that includes it. The price of the PRO model is already 35% higher than the standard model. It's just an unnecessary deduction in what would've been a complete package.Conclusion: If you already have the PS5(of any model), there is very little justification in getting this model. If you don't have a 4k TV or a display capable of 120hz refresh rate then don't waste your money - the base/slim model of PS5 is more than enough to game on.\n\nWe recently upgraded from the PS4 to the PS5 and while the performance and graphics are undeniably impressive, we ran into an unexpected issue: our favorite headphones are no longer compatible. The PS5 uses a different plug-in setup than the PS4, which means we’ll have to retire our trusted headset and invest in a new one.It’s a bit disappointing, especially since the headphones still work perfectly. This experience highlights a broader point—when you upgrade your console, you may also need to upgrade your accessories. It’s something to keep in mind if you're planning the switch.Overall, the PS5 is a solid upgrade, but be prepared for some extra costs beyond just the console itself.",

I will begin to list here: limiting games on home screen to 5..you have to go into game library to open games, if you wana play anything that you have installed on it you have to scroll right and then open the library then scroll down to search for it. This used used to an option on ps4 but now on ps5 it is the only option and it is a far less pleasing process. Next. it has no web browser. Next. I dont like the controller much, it just fatigues my hands much more quickly than the ds4 and I just dont appreciate the idea than i dont have different options. it feels poorly. Next. the shape is quite inneficent doesnt matter much but it is quite lacking in utility. Next. Bad coil whine. Ive had two ps5s now and can say they all had far worse ellectronic buzz and rattling noise compared to my ps4 and ps3 soley because of the cheap electronics parts sony uses on their psu arent quite of the same standard of yesteryear consoles or many other console systems in general. Next. Theres no option to quick shut off the system with three simple button presses like on the ps3 and ps4 instead you have to navigate several menus to shut it off. Next. Im probably missing some other things but other than that i feel that the ps5 pro is lacking in but it escapes my mind at the moment  Now. what does the ps5 pro have that the ps4 doesnt have? Two things. Frame rate and a small pool of exclusive games. Other than that it will feel a total downgrade from the ps4 in every way, and it is.",

Everything inside seems correct and the system functions as it should. Though I have no clue if this was used and returned or what the situation is. The console isn't cheap, even with the $50 discount so you'd expect better. It's a significant process for me to return this, so I guess I'll keep it for now unless something happens before the return date.-It's still frustrating that the system is digital only and requires a separate disc drive to function properly. No one wants a more expensive model of a console just so they have to buy all their old games again from their digital store. If they are remastered versions, fine, but most don't have that.-The system doesn't prioritize highspeed bandwidth, I have a triple band router that sends out 2.4, 5, and 6ghz. Console is designed to take all three bandwidths, you'd expect it to use the strongest signal and highest speeds. It would choose 2.4ghz every time, the router is less than five feet away and has very low traffic on the 6ghz band with a 2GB internet package, so there's no reason it should prioritize the 2.4 band. Had to manually change the priority on the console to 6ghz and now it works fine, if I didn't know how to do this I would be irate with the performance. Went to download some things and one game update said it would take over four hours to complete, downloading at under 20mbs. Can't have that when so many games and updates are massive data packages.The good so far.-Games run flawlessly from what I've seen so far. Have a TV that allows 120hz, so the framerate for the titles look great.-Played a couple 4k films and they looked great as well. No issues with motion or blurred movement, no drop in quality and the films definitely look like 4k resolution unlike streaming \"4k\" films and shows. Though the controls using the controller aren't exactly intuitive when trying to use the menus.\n\nSo far the unit works good.  They will not let me reset my password. On my email that I set up when PlayStation started  going online. With out having info that no one will have after over ten years so they told me to make a new email address  to use the game pass.\n\nThe console was awesome while it lasted. After only a year and a half, it is getting completely overheated without playing for 5 minutes. My husband had a PS4 over 10 years and never had this problem.

(3) the system is slow to start, (4) it seems requiring the internet all the time.As an off-line gamer, this is probably an over-kill unless you want some PS5 specific games.\n\nGarbage hdmi sturdiness, there needs to be 2-3 hdmis minimum, hdmi stopped working for ps4 too, and had to get an xbox series s which its hdmi is still working…",
