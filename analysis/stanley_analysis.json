  "zero_shot_summary": "Overall, customers have mixed reviews about the STANLEY Quencher H2.0 Tumbler. In terms of usage, many appreciate its ability to keep drinks cold for extended periods, often up to two days, making it ideal for long days or trips. The tumbler's insulation and the convenience of fitting into most cup holders are frequently praised. However, there are recurring concerns about the product's quality, specifically regarding the durability of the handle, which some customers have found to break easily. Additionally, there are issues with the lid leaking and the tumbler being prone to scratches and dents.\n\nA common theme in the reviews is dissatisfaction with the packaging and customer service. Some customers received their tumblers without adequate packaging, leading to concerns about damage during delivery. Moreover, there are complaints about the lack of responsiveness and support from Stanley's customer service, particularly in resolving issues related to missing components like straws or defective parts.\n\nDespite these issues, the tumbler is generally perceived as high quality in terms of its core function of temperature retention, and it is popular among users who prioritize this feature.
